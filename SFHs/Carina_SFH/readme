The files in this archive contain the star formation rate in different bins in age and [Fe/H], for the Carina dSph. The star formation rates are in units of Msun/yr formed over the duration of each bin. Therefore, to get the total mass in stars formed in a bin, you need to multiply the SFR with the duration of the bin (in years). 

The SFRs were obtained on a 2d grid of age and metallicity. Then the values were projected onto either age or metallicity to obtain the files you receive now. I can also send the full 2D information if you wish it. The units of SFR are Msun/year when given in terms of age and Msun/dex when given in terms of metallicity. For this reason, values in terms of metallicity are much greater (integrated over 14Gyr of evolution). 

The extent of each of the 3 annuli used is given below:
annul1 = 0.000-0.150 deg away from the centre
annul2 = 0.150-0.300 deg
annul3 = 0.300-0.480 deg
